# Spotify AR Visualizer

This is a sample iOS app I made just for fun to become more familiar with ARKit and the [iOS Spotify SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/ios-sdk/). The app is simply a music visualizer presented with augmented reality in the real world...just watch the demo:

## App Features

* You can play your own Spotify music through the app
* Music visualizer responds to microphone levels
* Moving closer and further from AR orb increases and reduces the music's volume level.
* The app works with the ambient sounds where you are, no Spotify needed.
* You can the change the color of the AR particles.

## Try It Yourself

To try it out, you will need to change the Development Team in Xcode to your own so you can run on your own iOS device. **This will only work on devices that support ARKit, so iPhonee 6S and later**.
